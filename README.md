# Mental_Health_Fitness_Tracker

## Overview

This repository contains the code and analysis for a Mental Health Fitness Tracker using Machine Learning techniques. The project focuses on exploring and analyzing a dataset related to mental health, performing statistical tests, and implementing various supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms.

## Dataset

The project utilizes a CSV file as the dataset, and the `pandas` library is employed to read and manipulate the data.

## Statistical Analysis

1. **Descriptive Statistics:**
   - Calculated mean, median, and mode for the given dataset.

2. **Statistical Tests:**
   - Conducted F-test, chi-square test, and t-test to gain insights into the dataset.

## Supervised Learning

Implemented the following supervised learning algorithms:

1. **Linear Regression**
2. **Logistic Regression**
3. **Decision Tree**
4. **Random Forest**
5. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
6. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
7. **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**

## Unsupervised Learning

Implemented the following unsupervised learning algorithms:

1. **K-Means**
2. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**

## Performance Analysis

Evaluated and compared the performance of all implemented machine learning algorithms. This includes metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.

## Comparison Analysis

Conducted a detailed comparison analysis of the machine learning algorithms used in both supervised and unsupervised learning. This involves discussing the strengths, weaknesses, and suitable use cases for each algorithm.

## Usage

Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
